# Project1-Wolfhire
WolfHire is a school project writen in Java.
The purpose of the project is to create a software that is able to read a file of positions and their applicants. The software allows the user to 
perform actions on each applicant for the given position. They can move the applicant through a hiring process with steps such as Assign, Reject, Resubmit,
Return, Schedule, Process, Hire, and Terminate. I demonstrated numerous of Java skills through creating this software, such as Finite State Machines(FTM), 
Enumerations, Interfaces, File readers and writers, and Singletons.
